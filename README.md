# Handwritten Text Recognition using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## Overview
- This repository contains an implementation of Handwritten Text Recognition using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm.
- The goal of this project is to recognize handwritten text characters and evaluate the model's performance.

## K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a simple and intuitive machine learning algorithm for classification and regression tasks.
- It classifies a data point by considering the majority class or averaging the values of its k nearest neighbors in the feature space.
- The choice of the hyperparameter k influences the algorithm's sensitivity to local variations in the data.

## Implementation
The project employs the following key libraries for efficient handling of machine learning functionalities :
- NumPy for numerical operations.
- Pandas for data manipulation.
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.
- Scikit-learn for machine learning functionalities.

## Evaluation
- The model's performance is evaluated using KNN with varying values of K (3, 5, 7, 9, 11).
- The evaluation metrics provide insights into the model's effectiveness in recognizing handwritten text characters.
